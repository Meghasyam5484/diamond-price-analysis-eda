# Diamond Price Analysis using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes a real-world diamonds dataset to understand how features like
carat, cut, color, and clarity affect diamond prices using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

## 🧾 Dataset
- Number of records: ~53,940 diamonds
- Key features: carat, cut, color, clarity, depth, table, price, x, y, z

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## 📊 Analysis Performed
- Descriptive statistics for numeric features
- Distribution of diamond prices
- Price comparison by cut, color, and clarity
- Carat vs price relationship
- Correlation heatmap for numeric attributes

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Diamond price increases significantly with carat weight.
- Ideal and Premium cuts tend to have higher average prices.
- Better color and clarity grades generally fetch higher prices.
- Carat has the strongest positive correlation with price.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Load the `diamonds.csv` file into your environment (Colab / Jupyter).
2. Open and run the notebook: `diamond_price_eda.ipynb`.
